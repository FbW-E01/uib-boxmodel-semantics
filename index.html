          <h3>How is immersive theatre different?</h3>
          <p>
            Many people go to the theatre to be transported into another world.
            However, no kind of theatre transports an audience quite like
            immersive theatre. In immersive theatre, the audience are not merely
            passive bystanders. They are part of the story, and they are in the
            middle of the action.

          <h3>What makes immersive theatre a great experience?</h3>
          <p>When done right productions focus on these six elements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              creates a physical environment that differs from a traditional
              theater where audiences sit in seats and watch a show unfurl on a
              stage with a curtain
            </li>
            <li>
              tends to stimulate all five senses, not just sight and sound
            </li>
            <li>doubles as an art installation and hands-on museum</li>
            <li>
              makes individual audience members feel as if they have had a
              uniquely personal experience, that they are not just part of the
              crowd
            </li>
            <li>
              often emphasize social interactions, either through directed tasks
              in small groups, or by fostering a looser party atmosphere
            </li>
            <li>has a story to tell—and gives respect to storytelling</li>
          </ul>
