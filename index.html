                    Jonathan Hickman (born September 3, 1972) is an American comic book writer and artist. He is known for creating the Image Comics series The Nightly News, The Manhattan Projects and East of West, as well as working on Marvel Comics' Fantastic Four, FF,
                    and S.H.I.E.L.D. titles. In 2012, Hickman ended his run on the Fantastic Four titles to write The Avengers and The New Avengers, as part the "Marvel NOW!" relaunch. In 2013, Hickman wrote a six-part miniseries, Infinity, plus Avengers
                    tie-ins for Marvel Comics. In 2015, he wrote the crossover event Secret Wars.

                    Not so long ago, it was touch and go for the X-Men. Their adventures in the pages of Marvel Comics were hardly making a dent in the minds of the average reader. This may have been by design, to a certain extent, possibly owing to the fact that Marvel’s
                    parent company, Disney, didn’t have the X-characters’ film rights. Although there’s never been formal confirmation of this policy, it’s long been said that Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter issued an edict at some point in the
                    2010s: Screw the X-Men. Though those rumors are probably more extreme than what actually happened — there was still A-list talent being put on the X-books here and there, like writer Brian Michael Bendis or artist Stuart Immonen —
                    you couldn’t shake the feeling that Marvel was spending far more money and energy on fostering titles that starred characters who also appeared in Disney’s Marvel movies. Whatever the reason, the X-Men series stopped presenting big,
                    grabby ideas. Even when talented writers were assigned to guide the mutants, the stories felt like empty nostalgia exercises filled with half-hearted quips and small-scale threats. Nothing was catching on. Well, suffice it to say that
                    all that’s changed, and it turns out that all it took was the deft, firm hand of a 46-year-old former architecture student. Jonathan Hickman — a lifelong geek trained in the art of designing buildings before he worked in advertising
                    and then decided to try his hand at comics writing in the mid-aughts — recently took over scribe duties on Marvel’s X-Men comics. Reading them now is like falling in love after years of luckless dating. Hop onto Twitter on a given
                    Wednesday, the day new comic-book issues come out, and you’ll find the tag “#xspoilers” — so named because users can mute all tweets with that tag if they haven’t had a chance to read the new issue yet and aren’t ready to join the
                    conversation. But when they are ready, what a conversation there is to be had. People are screenshotting their favorite moments left and right, tossing out their theories about where it’s all going, dissecting all the metaphors and
                    references, and just generally squealing over how into it they are: “We’ll be talking about what this issue MEANS for a long time but I could spend hours just talking about how it LOOKS,” they say; or “it’s just fucking fantastic”;
                    or simply, “THIS IS SOME WILD SHIT.”

                <h1>We need some INFO-graphics!</h1>

                <p>
                    Throughout his comic book career, from his run on Avengers to creator owned work like Pax Romana, Jonathan Hickman has utilized infographics and text pages to establish the rules and structures of the worlds he creates. House of X and Powers of X take
                    this iconic element of Hickman’s writing style to a whole new level, hinging the legitimacy of this new mutant status quo, and its future, on these moments throughout the story. In the wake of Charles Xavier’s declaration to the Marvel
                    Universe of the new mutant order, Hickman uses countless infographics as a foundation for the past, present and future of mutantkind.

                <p>
                    If the first few issues of House of X and Powers of X are any indicator, data pages like the ones seen halfway throughout the series play a major role in Jonathan Hickman's new X-Men story. In a very Hickman move, both new series come with charts, maps,
                    infographics, and even full-text pages explaining vital parts of the story. Although it's been done before (including by Hickman himself in his acclaimed Avengers run), House and Powers of X's use of non-traditional comics storytelling
                    techniques feel especially intriguing for a Big Two comic — the next evolution, perhaps?
