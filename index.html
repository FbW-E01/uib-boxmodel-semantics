        <h3>The Terrace Reminder</h3>
        <p>
          A Stolperstein (pronounced [ˈʃtɔlpɐˌʃtaɪn]; plural Stolpersteine;
          literally "stumbling stone", metaphorically a "stumbling block") is a
          sett-size, ten-centimetre (3.9 in) concrete cube bearing a brass plate
          inscribed with the name and life dates of victims of Nazi
          extermination or persecution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Stolpersteine project, initiated by the German artist Gunter
          Demnig in 1992, aims to commemorate individuals at exactly the last
          place of residency—or, sometimes, work—which was freely chosen by the
          person before he or she fell victim to Nazi terror, euthanasia,
          eugenics, deportation to a concentration or extermination camp, or
          escaped persecution by emigration or suicide. As of December 2019,
          75,000[1] Stolpersteine have been laid, making the Stolpersteine
          project the world's largest decentralized memorial.

          The majority of Stolpersteine commemorate Jewish victims of the
          Holocaust.Others have been placed for Sinti and Romani people (then
          also called "gypsies"), homosexuals, the physically or mentally
          disabled, Jehovah's Witnesses, black people, members of the Communist
          Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the anti-Nazi Resistance, the
          Christian opposition (both Protestants and Catholics), and Freemasons,
          along with International Brigade soldiers in the Spanish Civil War,
          military deserters, conscientious objectors, escape helpers,
          capitulators, "habitual criminals", looters, and others charged with
          treason, military disobedience, or undermining the Nazi military, as
          well as Allied soldiers.

      <h2 class="multilevel">A Multilevel Metaphor</h2>
      <div class="perspective">
        <h3>Looking backwards for the Way Forward</h3>
        <p>
          The name of the Stolpersteine project invokes multiple allusions. In
          Nazi Germany, an antisemitic saying, when accidentally stumbling over
          a protruding stone, was: "A Jew must be buried here".[5][6] In a
          metaphorical sense, the German term Stolperstein can mean "potential
          problem".[7] The term "to stumble across something", in German and
          English, can also mean "to find out (by chance)".[8] Thus, the term
          provocatively invokes an antisemitic remark of the past, but at the
          same time intends to provoke thoughts about a serious issue.
          Stolpersteine are not placed prominently, but are rather discovered by
          chance, only recognizable when passing by at close distance. In
          contrast to central memorial places, which according to Demnig can be
          easily avoided or bypassed, Stolpersteine represent a much deeper
          intrusion of memory into everyday life.

        <h3>The Stumble on the Terrace</h3>
        <p>
          Stolpersteine are placed right into the pavement. When Jewish
          cemeteries were destroyed throughout Nazi Germany, the gravestones
          were often repurposed as sidewalk paving stones. The desecration of
          the memory of the dead was implicitly intended, as people had to walk
          on the gravestones and tread on the inscriptions. The Stolpersteine
          provocatively hint at this act of desecration, as they lack any kind
          of defense against new acts of shame. While the art project thus
          intends to keep alive the memory, implying that improper acts could
          easily happen again, the intentional lack of defense against potential
          desecration also created criticism and concern. Some German cities
          like Munich still do not accept the setting of Stolpersteine, and look
          for alternative ways of commemoration instead.
